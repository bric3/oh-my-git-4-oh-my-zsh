It is based on the work of [fabulous work](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git/) of Arialdo Martini. \r\n\r\nThis derivative fork is taken from my pull request on his project [there](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git/pull/22).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThis new git information script (`oh-my-git.plugin.zsh`)\r\n   * is not rely on a prompt shell anymore\r\n   * is using configurable color codes\r\n   * doesn't leak variables\r\n   * does not depend on external configuration\r\n   * offers configurable color codes per symbol\r\n   * has a more understandable name, that can be easily used in another context (I'm using it in my own crafted oh-my-zsh theme, though it's named `oh-my-git.plugin.zsh`)\r\n   * offers suffix and prefix config\r\n   * enables toggling of the display of the git repository symbol (`display_git_symbol`)\r\n   * enables to toggle if empty spaces for _off_ flags will be displayed (`use_color_off=false` and flag is off, toggable with `print_unactive_flags_space`)\r\n   * enables toggling per git repository config `git config --get oh-my-zsh.hide-status`\r\n   * displays current git action (`REBASE-i`, `REBASE-m`, `REBASE`, `AM/REBASE`, `MERGING`, `BISECTING`, `CHERRY-PICKING`)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThis install assume the current shell is **ZSH** with [**oh-my-zsh**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) already installed.\r\n\r\nInstall a clone of this repository in oh-my-zsh plugin [custom folder](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization). *Note it is possible to change the default custom directory of oh-my-zsh by redefining the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` in the `.zshrc` *\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:bric3/oh-my-git-4-oh-my-zsh.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/oh-my-git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will make _oh-my-git_ available as a plugin for _oh-my-zsh_. Now you still need to activate it. In your `.zshrc` just activate the plugin by adding `oh-my-git` to the `plugins` variable :\r\n\r\n```\r\nplugins=(\r\n # custom plugins\r\n git2\r\n oh-my-git\r\n\r\n # bundled plugins\r\n github\r\n osx\r\n mosh\r\n ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally use the main function in your theme. For example to place it in the right part of your theme use the `RPROMPT` environment variable : \r\n\r\n```\r\nRPROMPT='$(oh_my_git_info)'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nA rather long demo with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/10426)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
